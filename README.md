## üí™ Motivation

<p>
Our aim is to allow people to take back the ownership of their mobile identity. Oligopolisitic telecommunication companies hold significant power on your mobile identity, the mobile has been an increasing integral parts of our life even becoming part of our identity. They act as an extension of our own identity, acting as our digital identity it offers a means of extending access to a wide range of services, such as mobile banking and mobile health, and even opportunities such as networking and jobs. Opportunities that would be especially important to those who have been particularly marginalized, such as women and those living in poverty. Quintessentially, the mobile identity boils down to the role of communication and interaction between new acquaintances and fostering bonds. But what can an individual do if telecommuncation companies decided to pull the plug for your identity? As such, our groups mission is to drive the separation of power of the mobile identity to the masses
